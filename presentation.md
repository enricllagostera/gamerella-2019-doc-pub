# Documenting and publishing your game

## Summary / Intro

* Hi! I'm Enric (he/him), PhD student at Concordia. I make / research alternative controller games and I'm also interested in political game design & game making tools.
* Documenting a game (during / after)
* Publishing
	* Actually, self-publishing and circulation.

## Documenting

* During your creation process
	* Sketches, initial ideas and concept art
		* Put some dates on it, it is great to get a sense of chronology later.
	* Devlogs
		* We can think of them as on-going reflections, as they happen: a project diary.
		* They are great for keeping track of how ideas changed and maybe going back to some of them later.
		* How to do it?
			* Logs on your project folder.
			* Post on your social media.
			* If you want something with more permanence, maybe some publicity, itch.io has a system for it.
		* They might be public or private.
		* They can help you find other link-minded folks, start conversations and build community.
	* Code
		* Version Control Systems
			* What?
				* These systems keep snapshots (called commits) of your project folder. Later on, you can backtrack or even start a new version of your project based on one of those commits.
			* Upsides
				* It helps you to organize your project in both time and structure.
				* Some platform also let you create and host a website for your project.
				* Some tools let you host your project on the cloud, so you have backups that you can download and start using on any computer.
				* This is a kind of tool that is super-used on the industry, so getting familiar with it can be useful when looking for work.
			* Downsides
				* It is complex, a bit bureaucratic, and full of jargon.
					* With great flexibility comes great complexity.
				* Some services (like GitHub) are owned by giant evil corporations (not an exaggeration).
				* There are limitations on file size and lots of details that can get in the way.
			* GitHub
	* Take some notes about your tools too.
		* What sites were helpful?
		* What were some useful things you learned?
		* What are the tools you are using?
* After finishing: preservation / circulation
	* Why preserve?
		* Games are terrible are terrible in keeping their history available. By preserving, we help others to create new things.
		* Your future self might want to build from what you already created
	* What to preserve?
		* Notes
		* Source materials
		* Source code
		* Tools
		* If you are working with a VCS system, your repository is a great start already!
	* How?
		* Website / media kits
			* Websites
				* [An example: Ritual of the Moon, from Kara Stone.](https://ritualofthemoongame.com/)
				* [An example: Baba is You.](https://hempuli.itch.io/baba)
				* [An example: Help Hurt Hopp.](https://managore.itch.io/help-hurt-hopp)
			* What is a media kit?
				* A project overview with summarized info, images, videos and links to where to get more info or contact you.
				* It is usually a web page, but it can also be a zip folder that people can download from your game page.
				* [An example: Nowhere Prophet.](https://www.nowhereprophet.com/press/)
				* [An example: HOT SWAP drive folder.](https://hotswapgame.github.io/)
		* Post-mortems
			* A brief summary
			* What went well?
			* What went wrong?
			* What have we learned?

## A word on licenses

* There is a continuum from more closed to open, with plenty of options for different things.
	* There are also some differences between code licenses and assets / print work.
		* Finally, licenses are not fail-proof: it is hard to enforce them as a solo / small creator, but it is important to be informed about them.
* [For your own work, there are some cool options, with even a handy tool for choosing a base license and exploring your options.](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)
	* [Public domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/)
	* There are options for letting people modify your games.
		* CC-BY-SA
		* CC-BY-NC-SA
	* There are options for letting people use and copy, but without selling or modifying it
		* CC-BY-NC-ND
* Remember to respect other people's work by following the terms of their licensed work and crediting everyone.

## Publishing

* Itch
	* What can I distribute on Itch?
		* Analog
			* Print and play
			* Zine-making
		* Digital
		* Tools, games, zines, books
	* Creator pages
		* As soon as you create an Itch account, you have a user page, which can become a creator page as soon as you upload something.
		* You can definitely use this page as a portfolio of games and things.
	* Game pages
		* Each project has a front page, where you show screenshots, videos, text about the game as well as a lot of meta data to help people find your game and understand what it is about.
	* The dashboard
		* Uploading things
		* Analytics
		* [An inside view: PIQUE.](https://enricllagostera.itch.io/pique)
	* Customizing your game page

	* Consider other distribution platforms
		* Steam
		* Google Play
		* Apple Store
		* Consoles
	* Raising funds for distribution
		* Crowdfunding
		* Looking for publishers
	* Let's consider circulation
		* Send your game to events.
			* Local events: Pixelles, FLOP, gather friends, zine fests.
			* Other places: AMAZE, GDC, Vector Festival, Different Games, Feral Vector
		* Send your game to press.
			* Having a media kit helps a bit.
			* Look for venues that talk about games that you think are similar or reach the audiences you want to talk to.
